				<h2>Background</h2>
			</header>
      <section>
			<p>My name is Benjamin J.K Wacky ereza, I was born August 3, 2001 in Uganda where I lived my childhood years. I moved to Melbourne Australia with my parents and two brothers when I was turning thirteen and I have lived in Melbourne ever since. </br>

Arriving in Australia this young meant that I could start the high school experience right along with my peers where I could learn and assimilate to the Australian culture more easily. Although not surprising, this also meant that I would lose my speaking proficiency of Luganda, my mother tongue, over the years even though I can understand it perfectly. </br>

Throughout my life, I have had a progression of hobbies, starting from playing video games all day, movies, trying out musical instruments( i.e; piano and Guitar), reading books to knowing everything about cars and many more in between. At the moment I am trying to explore my dancing abilities. Further more while in school I was playing soccer at every opportunity, not even the playing I did for my club would quench my hunger for the game.

          <h3>Education</h3>
          <p>I graduated high school in 2020 and received the VCE-Baccalaureate certificate. Building on from that, I am currently a student at RMIT university studying the Bachelor of Information Technology. </p>

				<h2>Career Interest</h2>

<section>
					<h3>Information Technology</h3>
					<p>As my final year of high school was winding up, I gradually realized that I want to have a career in the Technology industry. When I was in school I researched almost all job fields, I watched day in the life videos and weighed the pros/cons of different careers in an effort to find the career that resonated with me. And after doing some personality tests that told me I would be better as a writer, I decided a job in the technology industry was what I wanted. </p>
					<p>I decided that the Bachelor of IT degree would be a good start as there is a potential to specialise in many different fields of technology. I did not have to think long about which university would suit me, because hearing from my career adviser and other people RMIT was such an obvious choice for me. As I study at RMIT I want to develop skills that will enable me to become anything from DevOps developer or Network administrator to furthering my studies to work in A.I development.</p>

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			</header>		

  </section>	  
			<p>My Ideal job is to become a DevOps engineer. With a job like this I am able to be in a place where I can bring about tangible real world change. For example a Senior DevOps Engineer for SilverRail, is in a position to change and improve the systems that are responsible for the efficient and safe transportation of cargo. This position requires someone to have a background in IT this includes various programming languages, computer operating systems, software development and most importantly strong communications skills with team members and clients. </p>
			<p>Currently the skills I have are those that Iâ€™m learning from my subjects. This includes the basics of web development, python programming language, SQL DBMS concepts.
      Since I have the opportunity to study at RMIT, my plan is to make the most of this by continuing learning from these subjects and performing at my best.

        <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
        <p>The following evaluation is based on the results from Leadership-style-quiz, learning-styles, 16 personalities.</P>

        <p>These results help inform my idea of who I am and show the possibility why I do the things I do. When it comes to relating with others, I feel that this is a somewhat accurate representation of how I would like to be. Especially when it comes to leadership, I want to be the servant leader for my team and others. However, at the end of the day my goal is always to try to do what I know to be right and meet my goals regardless of personality type. </p>

        <h3>Project Idea.</h3>
        <p>My plan is to create a head-up display system that brings all the information and data needed to ensure an optimal driver experience. It will have features that improve situational awareness in any condition. Whether you are out in the wild on an adventure, or on the way to your office this smart system will give you the guidance you need.</p>
	<p>Ever since the development and improvement of HUD technology, innovators have been finding ways to implement HUD in the places where they are needed most. Initially this technology could only be affordable by the military, whose job was to ensure the safety and efficiency of flight pilots during their missions. Applying this technology for our normal everyday use is the natural step into the future. It cannot make sense for such technology to be privy to only those in the military, when it is very much possible for those on the road to have it. The fact is the priority for such features is for those in dangerous situations like the army. However, without downplaying this fact, it is also a fact that you are more likely to die in a car crash than in flying in the air. So, if the HUD technology being proposed for commercial use will deliver a higher level of decision making for drivers as for fighter pilots, then it should be a priority to put it on the road.</p>
	<p>To begin with, a vehicle that has this HUD technology implemented, will be able to project the virtual images at a distance. The projected images will include, and not limited to; car telemetry, GPS 3D live map.Safety features such as early warning and threat detection systems. The ability to connect to a smartphone via bluetooth inorder to project information from apps such as phone calls, messages from various apps and the ability to respond via the integrated smart voice interaction. In addition, the car will have a smart windshield screen protected by a double layer of windshield glass. This smart windshield will be able to project live feed of night vision cameras in front of the car. This way the driver can see at night. There will also be infrared cameras to detect possible threats, especially for those driving in wild or dangerous places.</p>
	<p>To make a HUD you would need a picture generating unit which is responsible for displaying the required features. Extensive research will be required to understand the processes that are needed in order to create a working system.</p>
	<p>The end goal for this technology is to see an increase in the situational awareness of drivers on a road. In addition, the global implementation will hopefully be a drop in road accidents due to lack of concentration and awareness. </p>
