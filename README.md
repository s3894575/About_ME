      <section>
			<p>My name is Benjamin J.K Wacky ereza, I was born August 3, 2001 in Uganda where I lived my childhood years. I moved to Melbourne Australia with my parents and two brothers when I was turning thirteen and I have lived in Melbourne ever since. </br>

Arriving in Australia this young meant that I could start the high school experience right along with my peers where I could learn and assimilate to the Australian culture more easily. Although not surprising, this also meant that I would lose my speaking proficiency of Luganda, my mother tongue, over the years even though I can understand it perfectly. </br>

Throughout my life, I have had a progression of hobbies, starting from playing video games all day, movies, trying out musical instruments( i.e; piano and Guitar), reading books to knowing everything about cars and many more in between. At the moment I am trying to explore my dancing abilities. Further more while in school I was playing soccer at every opportunity, not even the playing I did for my club would quench my hunger for the game.

          <h3>Education</h3>

				<h2>Career Interest</h2>

					<h3>Information Technology</h3>
					<p>As my final year of high school was winding up, I gradually realized that I want to have a career in the Technology industry. When I was in school I researched almost all job fields, I watched day in the life videos and weighed the pros/cons of different careers in an effort to find the career that resonated with me. And after doing some personality tests that told me I would be better as a writer, I decided a job in the technology industry was what I wanted. </p>
					<p>I decided that the Bachelor of IT degree would be a good start as there is a potential to specialise in many different fields of technology. I did not have to think long about which university would suit me, because hearing from my career adviser and other people RMIT was such an obvious choice for me. As I study at RMIT I want to develop skills that will enable me to become anything from DevOps developer or Network administrator to furthering my studies to work in A.I development.</p>

				<section>
					<h3>Philosophy</h3>
					<p>While there I don't have formal education in philosophy it is very much an interest of mine.</p>
					<p>Always interested in reading and learning more! I can not recommend having another interest enough outside of Information Technology. Such development and passion in other areas can only benefit you more.</p>

				<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			</header>		

      </section>	  
			<p>My Ideal job is to become a DevOps engineer. With a job like this I am able to be in a place where I can bring about tangible real world change. For example a Senior DevOps Engineer for SilverRail, is in a position to change and improve the systems that are responsible for the efficient and safe transportation of cargo. This position requires someone to have a background in IT this includes various programming languages, computer operating systems, software development and most importantly strong communications skills with team members and clients. </p>
			<p>Currently the skills I have are those that Iâ€™m learning from my subjects. This includes the basics of web development, python programming language, SQL DBMS concepts.
      Since I have the opportunity to study at RMIT, my plan is to make the most of this by continuing learning from these subjects and performing at my best.

        <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
        <p>The following are based on the Leadership-style-quiz, learning-styles, 16 personalities.</p>
        <p>These results help inform my idea of who I am and show the possibility why I do the things I do. When it comes to relating with others, I feel that this is a somewhat accurate representation of how I would like to be. Especially when it comes to leadership, I want to be the servant leader for my team and others. However, at the end of the day my goal is always to try to do what I know to be right and meet my goals regardless of personality type. </p>
